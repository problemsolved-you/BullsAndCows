# Bulls and Cows
A fun little number guessing game.

##How to Play
Start by typing in a four digit number.

The number of "Bulls" is the number of digits
that are in the correct position.

The number of "Cows" is the number of digits
that are part of the secret number, but **not**
in the right position.

###Example
Assume that the secret number for this round is 1234

A guess of "1357" would yield one bull (the 1)
and one cow (the 3)

### Goal
Try and guess the secret number with the fewest 
guesses possible!
